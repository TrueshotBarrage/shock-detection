# Stroke Detection Module
Stroke Detection Module for Arduino Uno.

## Materials used
* Arduino Uno
* MPU-6050 accelerometer & gyroscope
* 5V battery
* A few M-M & M-F wires & breadboard

## Functionality
Detects stroke attacks by gauging fall velocity and angle of fall to determine whether someone has fallen and needs to send a distress signal. The distress signal consists of a loud, obnoxious noise followed by an SOS signal to an outside help (like 911), using Bluetooth.
